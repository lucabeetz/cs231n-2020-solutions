My solutions for the cs231n 2020 assignments

For the last few weeks I have been watching the cs231n 2016 and 2017 lectures and doing the accompanying assignments. It truly is a great introductory
course to deep learning and I can fully recommend it to anyone interested in the topic.

As a side note: Justin Johnson is now an assistant professor at the University of Michigan and has created an updated version of the course there, covering more
recent advancements in the fields of deep learning and computer vision: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJYGatp4SvA&list=PL5-TkQAfAZFbzxjBHtzdVCWE0Zbhomg7r
